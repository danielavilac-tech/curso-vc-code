HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML 
pages. With HTML constructs, images and other
objects such as interactive forms may be embedded
into the rendered page. HTML provides a means 
to create structured documents or denoting 
structural semantics for text such as headings,
paragraphs, lists, links, quotes, and other 
items. HTML elements are delineated or 
tags, written using angle brackets. 
Tags such as <img> and <input> directly 
introduce content into the page. Other
tags such as <p> and </p> surround and 
provide information about document text
and may include sub-element tags.
Browsers do not display the HTML tags,
but use them to interpret the content 
of the page.
